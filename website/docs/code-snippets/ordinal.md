This may be useful for join feeds - showing `You're the 5th member` is nicer than `You're member #5`.

## Code

```gotmpl file=../../../src/code_snippets/ordinal.go.tmpl

```

## Usage

First, add the code snippet:

```gotmpl
{{/* code snippet goes here */}}
```

Next, change the value of `$int` to what you want:

```diff {3}
{{/* Let $int be the integer. */}}
- {{ $int := 123 }}
+ {{ $int := .Guild.MemberCount }}
{{/* Rest of snippet goes here */}}
```

And that's it! `$ord` will be the ordinal for the integer `$int`.

```gotmpl {2}
{{/* code snippet goes here */}}
You are the {{$int}}{{$ord}} member!
```
