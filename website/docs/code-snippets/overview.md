This is a collection of useful "snippets", or parts of code, that you can implement. For example, this folder includes code snippets to convert a string to time, an implementation of selection sort, and some more useful things. Take a look around!

:::note Licensing

As this code is meant to be freely used as part of other code with restriction or need for attribution, _most_ code snippets are licensed under the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/).
In other words, feel free to do whatever. You don't need to attribute us, but we'd certainly be happy if you did!

**Which snippets are under the Unlicense?**

As some of the snippets were authored by people weren't contacted about the licensing change yet, anything not authored by [@jo3-l](https://github.com/jo3-l/) should still be considered subject to the terms of the MIT license.

:::caution

Most code in this folder cannot be copy-pasted. It is here for you to understand and use in your own code. Do not expect to be able to copy-paste this.
