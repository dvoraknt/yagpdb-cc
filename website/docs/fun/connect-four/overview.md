title: Overview
---

This allows you to play a game of connect-four with yourself or against another player.

## Installing

As usual, there are instructions describing where to put the script and which trigger to use on the pages corresponding to the individual commands. Both of the following commands need to be installed for this system to work correctly:

- [Start game command](start-game)
- [Reaction handler](reaction-handler)

As the setup for this system is not too complicated, we'll leave it at that. Please refer to the instructions in the pages linked above if you have any other questions.
