## Trigger

**Type:** `Regex`<br />
**Trigger:** `\A(?:\-|<@!?204255221017214977>)\s*(?:c(?:on(?:nect)?)?4)(?: +|\z)`

By default, this regex uses the `-` prefix for commands. If you have a different prefix, change the `-` to your own prefix.
For example, if you wanted to use `!` as the prefix, you would use:

`\A(?:\!|<@!?204255221017214977>)\s*(?:c(?:on(?:nect)?)?4)(?: +|\z)`
