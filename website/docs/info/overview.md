These commands are all standalone (you can pick and choose which commands to add). Most of these commands are informational commands which are not currently available to YAGPDB (channel info, avatar, server info, etc.)

As usual, there are instructions describing where to put the script and which trigger to use on the pages corresponding to the individual commands.
