## Usage

You can view a similar help message to the following in Discord by running `-leveling` with no arguments.

:::

- `-leveling set cooldown <duration>` - Sets the cooldown between giving messages.
- `-leveling set min <num>` - Sets the lower bound of the range of experience that can be given when a user sends a message.
- `-leveling set max <num>` - Sets the upper bound of the range of experience that can be given when a user sends a message.
- `-leveling set-channel <channel|'none'>` - Sets the channel where level-up announcements will be sent. The default is to send it in the channel where the user leveled up, but you can also set it to a fixed channel by providing a channel. To use the default of the channel where the user leveled up, use `none` as the channel.
- `-leveling set-announcements <bool>` - Sets whether level-up announcements should be sent.
- `-leveling view` - Views the current leveling settings.

:::info Aliases
