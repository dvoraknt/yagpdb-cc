A minimalistic tag system with no bells and whistles.

:::note

For a more feature-rich command system, we advise that you look at Black Wolf's [snippet system](https://github.com/BlackWolfWoof/yagpdb-cc/tree/master/Snippets).

:::

## Features

- Create, update, and delete text-based tags.
- Supports aliases.
- View information about tags.
- List tags.
- Use tags by running `;name` where `name` is the name of the tag.

## Installation

As usual, there are instructions describing where to put the script and which trigger to use on the pages corresponding to the individual commands. You will need to add both of the following commands for the system to work correctly:

- [Main command](main-cc)
- [Reaction handler](reaction-handler)

As the setup for this system is not too complicated, we'll leave it at that. Please refer to the instructions in the pages linked above if you have any other questions.
